        <h2 className='title'>Eyeonic was founded in 2023 by two scientists to answer this question:</h2>
        <p className='info-text'>Doesn't everyone deserve to look good while wearing an affordable pair of glasses? The mission was clear: Give people glasses they can actually afford but still make them look like a million bucks. It started small, a little company with big ideas, but it quickly grew into a phenomenon. Fashionistas, moms on-the-go, discerning customers; everyone found that they could get the selection they deserved at prices they could afford with Eyeonic</p>
        <p className='info-text'>Eyeonic has since grown into an online optical industry leader. That's prescription eyeglasses online. Prescription sunglasses online. Non-prescription sunglasses online.</p>
